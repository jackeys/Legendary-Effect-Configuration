# Legendary Effect Configuration

Presents a configuration menu in Mod Configuration Menu for toggling all legendary effects from Fallout 4 and its Far Harbor expansion. This is done by searching through the array of legendary rules in the custom legendary item quest from the base game. Since the exact legendary rules are known, they can also be added back into the list to toggle the effect back on.

Far Harbor is not required to use the mod, and the effects from Far Harbor only show up if it's installed. This is done by looking at a global variable in Far Harbor and using that as a condition in the menu.

## Installation

See the [mod page on NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/65986/) for releases. Installation using a mod manager such as Vortex is recommended, but the files can also just be copied into the Data folder of your Fallout 4 installation.
